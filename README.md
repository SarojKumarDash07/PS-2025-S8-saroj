## Resistance 

![Diagram](docs/1.png)

- Consider a block of metal or semiconductor material with dimensions $L$, $W$ and $h$ as shown in figure above.
- Let $n$ be the charge per unit volume.
- To calculate the current $Ir$ for an applied voltage $Vr$ across the length of the material, we will consider an incremental cross section of the material with length $Δx$.
- The current can be written as the total charge in the incremental volume in time $Δt$.

- Here $Qs$ is the sheet-charge or the charge per unit length, $Vd$ is the average velocity of the electrons.
- Where $μ$ is the mobility of the material, $ρ$ is the Specific resistivity which is a property of the material that can be defined as the resistance per unit volume expressed in SI units of $Ωm$ but more conveniently as $Ωcm$.
- Here $ρ/h$ is typically called sheet-rho ($ρsheet$).
- The total resistance of the volume can be found by summing up all incremental resistances $ΔR$ resulting in $R$.

## Capacitance
  
![Diagram](docs/2.png)

- Consider two parallel metal plates of area $A$ separated by distance $d$ as shown in the figure.
- If the total charge on the top and bottom plate is $+Q$ and $-Q$ respectively, and the potential on the plates are $V1$ and $V2$ respectively, total charge on the plate is directly proportional to the potential difference ($V = V1 - V2$):
